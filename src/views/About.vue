      <h3>
        Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework for
        building user interfaces.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up
        to be incrementally adoptable.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick
        up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering
        sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with
        modern tooling and supporting libraries.
