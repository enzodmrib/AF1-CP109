    <h1>Vue landing Page</h1>
    <h3>Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces.</h3>
    <h3>Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.</h3>
    <h3>The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects.</h3>
    <h3>On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.</h3>
